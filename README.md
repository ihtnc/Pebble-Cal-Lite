Universal Calendar App

A Pebble watch app converted to a watch face for my personal use case (read: convenience). Based from the code found in https://github.com/Jnmattern/pebble-cal. 

I like to have a calendar on the Pebble watch although most if not all are watch apps (which makes sense for navigating the calendar). However, I would like to have a "quick access" calendar which I can directly scroll to from my main watch face. Thus, the need to convert the nice watch app to a watch face.

I also added month names, day names, and non working days specific to my country.
